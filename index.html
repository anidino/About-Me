        <p> 
        Hello! My name is Ani Elaina Carr. I am a photography and editor living in Virginia Beach, Virginia. I am 31 years old, hold a 
        bachelor's degree in Studio Art, and am currently learning how to code.
        </p>

        <p>
        I love spending time with my husband, whom is also my teammate in our photography & videography business. I also enjoy painting, 
        listening to music, singing, reading, dancing, and playing board games. A relevant fact about myself is that I am diagnosed with Autism.
        </p>

        <p>
        This is an exciting time in my life for me. I finally have the means to go back to school for something I feel passionate about and 
        have been interested in for years. I look forward to the hard work, knowledge, and collaboration with others. 
        I also think about the new doors that aquiring this knowledge will open. I have a particular interest in developing bots for platforms 
        such as Discord and I know my abilities in this area will soon be greatly enhanced. 
        </p>
