          <p>
            Hello! My name is Ani Elaina Carr. I am a photographer and editor living in Virginia Beach, Virginia. I am 31
            years old, hold a
            bachelor's degree in Studio Art, and am currently learning how to code.
          </p>

          <p>
            I love spending time with my husband, whom is also my teammate in our photography & videography business. I
            also enjoy painting,
            listening to music, singing, reading, dancing, and playing board games. A random fact about myself is
            I'm autistic. 
          </p>

          <p>
            This is an exciting time in my life for me. I finally have the means to go back to school for something I
            feel passionate about and
            have been interested in for years. I look forward to the hard work, knowledge, and collaboration with
            others.
            I also think about the new doors that aquiring this knowledge will open. I have a particular interest in
            developing bots for platforms
            such as Discord and I know my abilities in this area will soon be greatly enhanced.
          </p>
